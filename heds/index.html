<h2 id="i-hate-it-in-here">I hate it in here</h2>
<p>I suspect, though, of course, have no proof, that the first time I dislocated something, I was nine or ten. I was walking across the floor apparatus of the gym where I was training for the level seven competition season. The thing about gymnastics floors is they're pretty squishy. Beneath the blue carpet is a dense layer of ankle- and knee-cushioning foam (beneath that is plywood over sizeable springs), and the carpet is often many strips of carpet with appreciable seams velcroed together along their edges. Completely ignoring any risk to my mother's back, I trod diagonally across one of the cracks in our floor's carpet. It felt like I'd stepped on a dull pencil. Sharp, shooting pain inexplicably lit up the ball of my left foot. Panicked by novel pain that outstripped every rip or bruise I'd ever had, I jumped onto the other foot and examined the spot that hurt.</p>
<p>Nothing appeared amiss. The initial agony had faded somewhat, so I tried to put weight on it, felt another round of the blinding pain, a pop, and then sweet relief. I think I was walking with my dearest teammate, Justina, but I concede memories so old are usually very distorted. She was incredibly kind, understanding, and the only person I ever trained with who was more flexible than I was.</p>
<p>I think I remember her helping steady me as I hopped around looking daft to everyone who had noticed my dance. She never made me feel bad for continually complaining about joint pains. I usually needed to tape at least one ankle to train. Ultimately, soft tissue pain nobody could trace (mostly using x-rays) and despair are why I quit after my first level nine meet. It was a fiasco, and if I or any of my coaches had known about hEDS, I wonder if I could have postponed the starting pistol on my CPTSD.</p>
<h2 id="collagen">Collagen</h2>
<p>I am a hobbyist scientist at best, some college physics and biology, but I'm no <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Evans_(journalist)">Dr. of macheticine</a>, so here's someone more qualified to explain the chemistry and physiology:</p>

<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis?</h2>
<p>Hahahahaha! This is America.</p>
<h3 id="generational-medical-trauma">Generational Medical Trauma</h3>
<p>By the time I came along, my mother was well and truly fed up with doctors. She went undiagnosed for a thyroid disorder for decades. She was over- and under-medicated by various specialists for my entire childhood, at least. I would go to the doctor when I had an intractible sinus infection or a broken bone. Annual checkups wasn't something we did. Even if we had, I wonder if anyone would have even thought to ask the questions one does to get "Ehlers-Danlos" for an answer.</p>
<p>I assumed my chronic joint problems were just the logical result of a seven year gymnastics career, that every other ex-gymnast in their early twenties had debilitating shoulder and knee problems. The first time I started seeking medical care was when I got the good insurance during graduate school. The UF physical therapists did wonders for my right knee, but that was just the first of many spot-treatments of manifestations of a connective tissue disorder. Over the subsequent decade, I would get x-rays, MRIs, radiograph-guided athroscopic injections, and more rounds of physical therapy than I can remember. I adapted my teaching practice to eliminate writing on the board because it was too much wear and tear on my shoulders and neck. My sleep got worse and worse. My marriage suffered.</p>
<h3 id="other-bendy-people">Other Bendy People</h3>
<p>I don't think I ever heard of Ehlers-Danlos before a friend of a friend with profoundly flexible elbows and knees mentioned it. He had managed it better than I on account of knowing what the hell was happening to him. It made me so jealous because I had felt for years that something wasn't adding up. Physical therapy could be helpful, but sometimes it seemed to make things worse. I would get respectable amounts of exercise and eat well but experience months on end of oppressive fatigue.</p>
<h3 id="genetic-testing">Genetic Testing</h3>
<p>Despite being the most common variant, hypermobile EDS has no genetic test. As far as I can tell, I am diagnosed to the extent one can be (clinical). Because it wasn't recorded earlier, I don't score as highly as I would have.</p>
